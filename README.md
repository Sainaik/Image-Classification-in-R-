# Image-Classification-in-R-

As bigginer to ML and  CNN this is my basic project.
Here I'm gonna classify  images with the help of some power full library "Keras" through which i create a CNN Model to classify,
whether the given picture is of tigers or non tiger.
For image pre-processing i used "Imager" Library.

Training Data has 30  images
Testing data Has 10 images
